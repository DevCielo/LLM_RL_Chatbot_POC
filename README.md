# AI Customer Service Assistant â€“ Proof of Concept

## Overview
This project is a **proof-of-concept AI assistant** designed for an e-commerce platform, showcasing advanced AI integration to enhance customer service and user engagement. The assistant leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Agent-Based Systems** to process natural language queries, manage orders, provide product information, filter irrelevant conversations, and deliver personalized recommendations using **Market Basket Analysis**.

## Features
- ðŸ’¬ **Natural Language Processing** â€“ Handles customer queries and orders through conversational AI.  
- ðŸ“‹ **Product Information Retrieval** â€“ Provides detailed product info using RAG.  
- ðŸ›’ **Personalized Recommendations** â€“ Utilizes **Market Basket Analysis** and **reinforcement learning** for tailored suggestions.  
- ðŸš« **Conversation Filtering** â€“ Blocks irrelevant conversations to maintain context.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Adaptive Learning** â€“ Continuously refines suggestions using reinforcement learning.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native, Firebase  
- **Backend:** RunPod (LLM hosting), AWS (**EC2**, **S3**, **Lambda**)  
- **APIs & Integrations:** Custom APIs on RunPod, Supabase, Kafka  
- **ML Infrastructure:** MLFlow, Docker, CI/CD Pipelines  
- **AI Models:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Market Basket Analysis, Reinforcement Learning

## Deployment
